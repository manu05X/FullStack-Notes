  Handling Input Changes:
    The handleChange function updates the input state with the user's input.
    It wraps the logic that generates a new list with startTransition(). This signals React that the following state update (setting the new list) can be deferred, allowing React to keep the UI responsive.

/*
Problems with the Current Implementation
Synchronous Updates:
The handleChange function updates the input state immediately, but the generation of newList and the subsequent state update for list is performed synchronously. This means that when the user types in the input field, the UI may freeze or become unresponsive while the newList is being created, especially since LIST_SIZE is set to 11,000.

UI Responsiveness:
When the list is being populated, the UI might not remain responsive. Users could experience delays in seeing their input reflected in the input box, especially if they type quickly. This can lead to a poor user experience, where the input feels sluggish or laggy.

Potential Performance Issues:
Since the list is updated in one go (all 11,000 items at once), it can lead to performance bottlenecks. The browser has to re-render the entire list, which could slow down the rendering process and result in janky behavior, especially if the component tree grows more complex.

Benefits of Using useTransition

Deferred State Updates:
By wrapping the state update logic inside startTransition, we signal to React that the resulting state updates can be deferred. This allows React to prioritize the immediate updates (like reflecting user input) and manage the less urgent updates (like updating the list).

Improved User Experience:
With useTransition, while the list is being generated in the background, the input field remains responsive. The user can continue typing without experiencing delays, as React can focus on updating the UI that requires immediate attention.

Loading Indicators:
You can easily implement loading indicators when transitioning between states, providing visual feedback to users that something is happening in the background. This can help users understand that their action is being processed.
