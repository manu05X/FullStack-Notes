# Code Splitting in Web Development

**Code splitting** is an optimization technique that allows you to break up your application into smaller chunks (bundles) which can be loaded on demand. Instead of delivering the entire JavaScript code at once, code splitting ensures that only the necessary parts are loaded when they are needed.

## Benefits of Code Splitting

### 1. Improved Performance & Faster Initial Load Times

- **Initial Load Optimization**: By splitting the code, you can reduce the size of the JavaScript bundle loaded initially by the browser. Smaller bundles make the page load faster.
- **Lazy Loading**: Code that's not immediately needed isn't loaded upfront but only when required. This is especially useful for routing, where different routes can be split into separate bundles.

> Example: An admin dashboard doesn't need to load its code until the user navigates to it. With code splitting, it loads only when required.

### 2. Better User Experience

- **Less Waiting Time**: Users can see the initial content of your app faster because they don't have to wait for the entire codebase to load.
- **Progressive Loading**: The rest of the code can be fetched in the background or on demand, making the app more responsive and faster.

### 3. Reduced Memory Usage

- Loading a large JavaScript bundle increases memory consumption because the browser has to parse, compile, and execute the entire file.
- With code splitting, only the necessary code is loaded, reducing memory usage and improving performance.

### 4. Optimizing Large Applications

- Large apps contain features that aren't always used. Code splitting helps by breaking down these features into separate bundles, which can be fetched only when needed.

> Example: A large third-party library like a charting library can be loaded only when users access a page with charts.

### 5. Handling Dependencies Efficiently

- If your app relies on large libraries, these libraries can be loaded only when needed, avoiding the initial overhead.

> Example: A charting library for the analytics page can be code split, so it's only loaded when the user visits that page.

### 6. Parallel Loading

- Browsers can load multiple smaller bundles in parallel more efficiently than loading a single large file. This decreases load time by allowing better network request handling.

### 7. SEO & Accessibility

- Faster initial load times improve user experience, which can lead to better SEO rankings. Performance is a key factor in search engine optimization (SEO) algorithms.

### 8. Example of Code Splitting with React

In React, code splitting can be achieved using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`:

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from "react";

// Dynamically load a component when needed
const MyComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./MyComponent"));

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <MyComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, MyComponent is only loaded when it’s needed. The fallback (<div>Loading...</div>) will be displayed while the component is being fetched.

### 9. Build Size Management

- In a continuous deployment setup, code splitting helps manage build size. Large features or modules are kept separate, making the build easier to manage and troubleshoot.

### Conclusion

- Code splitting is essential for optimizing web applications, especially as they grow in size and complexity. It reduces the initial loading time, makes applications feel faster, and improves overall performance by loading code only when it’s necessary. This leads to a better user experience, more efficient resource usage, and easier maintenance.

## Use of lazy in the code:

1. `Lazy Loading`: The lazy() function allows you to load components asynchronously when they are required, such as when a user navigates to a specific route (e.g., /about or /products). Instead of bundling these components into the initial JavaScript bundle, they are split into separate chunks that are fetched only when needed.

2. `Improved Performance`: By using lazy(), the browser doesn’t need to download all the code at once. For example, if the user only visits the homepage (/), the About, Products, and Testimonial components won’t be loaded until the user navigates to those routes. This reduces the initial page load time, leading to faster rendering of the UI.

3. `Efficient Resource Management`: Since components are loaded only when required, the application consumes fewer resources (like bandwidth and memory) on initial load, as it avoids unnecessary downloads.

## What is vite react and rollupjs

- Vite is a build tool that provides a fast and streamlined development experience for JavaScript frameworks like React. It's designed to be efficient and uses modern browser features to deliver a fast development experience.

- Vite and Rollup are both `tools used for building and bundling JavaScript projects`, but they have different focuses and use cases:

- `Vite`: A faster, newer tool that focuses on development experience. It's used for modern frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Svelte.

- `Rollup`: A more mature tool that focuses on production builds. It offers many customization and flexibility options.
- `Here are some of the features of Vite and Rollup:`
  - `Vite`: Vite's dev server offers a fast **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** feature that allows you to see changes in your React components almost instantly. Vite also works with modern JavaScript tools like TypeScript, JSX, and CSS preprocessors like Sass.
  - `Rollup`: Rollup is used by Vite to **optimize bundles for production**. It includes features like `automatic code splitting to improve your app's load time`. Rollup also allows you to split code based on different entry points and dynamic imports.
