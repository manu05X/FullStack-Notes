### **Detailed Explanation with Server and Client Contexts**

### **Server-Side (Backend) Context**

1. **Express.js Server (SA1)**:
    - The backend is built with Express.js, handling API requests and responses.

2. **User Registration Endpoint (/api/users/register) (SA2)**:
    - Handles user registration requests.
    - Checks if the user already exists in the database (SA8).
    - Encrypts the user's password using bcrypt (SA7).
    - Saves the new user to MongoDB (SA8).
    - Returns a success response to the client.

3. **User Login Endpoint (/api/users/login) (SA3)**:
    - Handles user login requests.
    - Finds the user by email in the database (SA8).
    - Validates the user's password using bcrypt (SA7).
    - Generates a JWT token for the user (SA6).
    - Returns the token and user data to the client.

4. **Protected Route Endpoint (/api/users/get-current-user) (SA4)**:
    - Protects specific routes that require user authentication.
    - Verifies the JWT token using authMiddleware (SA5).
    - Extracts the user ID from the token and retrieves user data from the database (SA8).
    - Returns the user data to the client if the token is valid.

5. **Middleware (authMiddleware) (SA5)**:
    - Middleware that verifies the JWT token.
    - Extracts the user ID from the token and passes it to the route handler.
    - Ensures that only authenticated users can access certain routes.

6. **JWT Token Generation (SA6)**:
    - Generates a JWT token during login that includes the user ID.
    - The token is signed with a secret key and has an expiration time.
    - The token is used to verify the user's identity on subsequent requests.

7. **Password Encryption (bcrypt) (SA7)**:
    - Bcrypt is used to hash and salt user passwords for security.
    - During registration, passwords are encrypted before being stored in the database.
    - During login, the provided password is compared with the stored hashed password.

8. **Database (MongoDB) (SA8)**:
    - MongoDB is used to store user data, including email, password, and other information.
    - User data is retrieved, updated, or created based on requests from the server.


### **Client-Side (Frontend) Context**

1. **React Application (CA1)**:
    - The frontend is built with React, handling user interactions and UI rendering.

2. **Registration Page (CA2)**:
    - The user fills out a registration form.
    - The form data is sent to the backend registration endpoint (/api/users/register) using axiosInstance (CA6).
    - If successful, a success message is displayed.

3. **Login Page (CA3)**:
    - The user fills out a login form.
    - The form data is sent to the backend login endpoint (/api/users/login) using axiosInstance (CA6).
    - If successful, the token is stored in local storage (CA7), and the user state is updated in Redux (CA5).

4. **ProtectedRoute Component (CA4)**:
    - A higher-order component that protects certain routes in the application.
    - It checks if a token exists in local storage (CA7).
    - If the token is valid, it allows access to the protected content.
    - If the token is missing or invalid, it redirects the user to the login page (CA3).

5. **Redux Store (CA5)**:
    - Manages global application state, including user data and loading state.
    - The `loaderSlice` manages loading indicators.
    - The `userSlice` manages the authenticated user's state.
    - The state is updated based on API responses from the backend.

6. **axiosInstance for API Calls (CA6)**:
    - A pre-configured instance of axios used to make API calls to the backend.
    - Includes the JWT token in the Authorization header for protected routes.
    - Handles API responses and updates the Redux store accordingly.
    
7. **Local Storage (Token Storage) (CA7)**:
    - Stores the JWT token received during login.
    - The token is used for authenticating subsequent API requests.
    - If the token is missing or invalid, the user is redirected to the login page.

### **Summary**

- The **server-side** handles user registration, login, and protection of specific routes using JWT tokens, bcrypt for password encryption, and MongoDB for data storage.
- The **client-side** manages user interactions, stores the JWT token, and uses Redux to manage global state. Protected routes are secured using the `ProtectedRoute` component, which checks the validity of the token before allowing access.
