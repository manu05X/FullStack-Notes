    - As setCount is setter function is a asynchronous function, it doesn't immediately update the state. After all code executes, then handleIncrement is called only one time.
    - Here, setCount is being called three times in a row, each using the same count value from the initial render or last render.
    - React batches these updates, so all three updates are executed before the component re-renders. Since count doesnâ€™t change within the execution of these updates, each setCount call adds 1 to the same stale value of count.
    - Effectively, the final result after all three updates is equivalent to count + 1, not count + 3.

  /*
  - Here, setCount is called three times, but each time, it uses the latest state (via the prev argument).
  - React ensures that each functional update gets the most up-to-date state value, even during the batching process. So:
    - The first call takes the current count and adds 1.
    - The second call takes the result of the first update and adds 1.
    - The third call takes the result of the second update and adds 1.
As a result, the state increases by 3.
