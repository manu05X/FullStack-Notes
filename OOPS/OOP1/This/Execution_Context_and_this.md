# Understanding Execution Context in JavaScript

## What is Execution Context?

An execution context is an abstract concept that holds information about the environment within which the current code is being executed. It contains variables, objects, and the value of the `this` keyword that the code can access.

### There are mainly two types of execution contexts in JavaScript:

1. **Global Execution Context**
2. **Function Execution Context**

### 1. Global Execution Context

- **Created**: When the JavaScript engine starts executing your script.
- **Contains**:
  - **Global Object**: In browsers, this is the `window` object; in Node.js, it's the `global` object.
  - **this keyword**: Refers to the global object.
- **Purpose**: Manages the code that is not inside any function.

### 2. Function Execution Context

- **Created**: Each time a function is invoked.
- **Contains**:
  - **Arguments Object**: An array-like object containing all arguments passed to the function.
  - **Variable Environment**: All variables defined within the function.
  - **Scope Chain**: References to its own scope, outer scopes, and the global scope.
  - **this keyword**: Depends on how the function is invoked.
- **Purpose**: Manages the execution of code within that specific function.

## Phases of Execution Context

Each execution context goes through two phases:

### 1. Creation Phase (Memory Allocation)

- Variables, functions, and the `this` keyword are set up.
- Functions are hoisted (their definitions are stored in memory).
- Variables are hoisted but set to `undefined`.

### 2. Execution Phase (Code Execution)

- Code is executed line by line.
- Variable assignments and function invocations happen.

## `this` Keyword in Different Contexts

The value of the `this` keyword depends on how and where a function is called:

### 1. Global Context

- In the global scope, `this` refers to the global object (`window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js).

### 2. Object Method

- When a function is called as a method of an object, `this` refers to the object itself.

### 3. Standalone Function

- In non-strict mode, `this` refers to the global object.
- In strict mode, `this` is `undefined`.

### 4. Constructor Function

- When using `new`, `this` refers to the newly created object.

### 5. Arrow Functions

- Do not have their own `this`; they inherit `this` from the enclosing context.

## Detailed Explanation of Your Code

```javascript
let obj2 = {
  name: "mrityunjay",
  age: "23",
  testFunction: function () {
    console.log(this);
    function g() {
      console.log(this);
    }
    g();
  },
};

obj2.testFunction();
```

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. Global Execution Context Creation

**Variables and Functions Defined:**

- `obj2`: Declared and defined as an object.

**`this` in Global Context:**

- **In Node.js:** `{}` (an empty object).
- **In Browsers:** `window` object.

### 2. Execution Phase

#### a. Defining `obj2`

- **An object `obj2` is created with:**
  - **Properties:**
    - `name`: `"mrityunjay"`
    - `age`: `"23"`
  - **Method:**
    - `testFunction`: A function defined within the object.

#### b. Calling `obj2.testFunction()`

- **Invocation:** `testFunction` is called as a method of `obj2`.

- **Function Execution Context Created for `testFunction`:**
  - **`this` Binding:** `this` is set to the object that invoked the function, i.e., `obj2`.

**Inside `testFunction`:**

```javascript
console.log(this);
```
