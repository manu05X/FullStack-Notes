    Debounce:
        debounce is a higher-order function that returns a debounced version of the work function.
        The timerId variable stores the ID of the setTimeout timer.
        optWorkFn is the function returned by debounce, which when called:
        Clears any previously set timer (if the function is called repeatedly in quick succession).
        Sets a new timer that waits for the specified delay before calling work.
        The result is that work only executes if there hasn't been another call to optWorkFn within the delay period, effectively "debouncing" the function.

    Throttle:
        throttle is another higher-order function that returns a throttled version of the work function.
        The flag variable controls when work can be executed.
        optWorkFn:
        Checks the flag. If true, it calls work and then sets the flag to false, preventing work from being called again until the interval has passed.
        A setTimeout is used to reset the flag after the interval period, allowing work to be called again.

          // Check if the flag is true.
          work(); // If true, call the work function immediately.
          flag = false; // Set the flag to false to prevent further execution.

          setTimeout(function () {
            flag = true; // Reset the flag to true after the specified interval.

    /*
    If throttledWork() is called at time t = 0 seconds, work() will execute immediately because the flag is initially true.
    The flag is then set to false, and no further calls to throttledWork() within the next 3 seconds will trigger work().
    After 3 seconds (t = 3), the flag is reset to true, so the next call to throttledWork() will again execute work().

<!-- 
Overall Explanation:
The debounce function ensures that the work function is only executed after a specified delay (3 seconds here) without any further calls. This is useful in scenarios like waiting for a user to stop typing before sending a search query.
The throttle function (though not used in this example) would ensure that work is executed at most once every specified interval, regardless of how frequently the event occurs. This is useful for actions like handling scroll events where you want to limit the frequency of function calls.
The input element in the DOM triggers the optimizedFn (debounced) on each key press, preventing the work function from executing until the user stops typing for 3 seconds.
